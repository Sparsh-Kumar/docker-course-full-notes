Image and Container
---------------------

Image
---------
- Image is the actual application packaged with all the necessary configuration and dependencies.
- This is actually the artifact, that can be moved around.

Container
---------
- Container is when I pull image on local machine and start the application.
- That is basically run in container environment.

IMPORTANT - If it is not running then, it is an artifact and it is known as image, if I start it then it is known as container as it is running in an isolated container.
